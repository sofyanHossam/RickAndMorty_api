## Flutter Rick and Morty App
# Overview
This Flutter project utilizes the Rick and Morty API to showcase characters from the TV show. The application employs the BLOC state management pattern to efficiently handle and update the app's state. Users can view all characters in a grid layout, search for specific characters, and view detailed information with hero animation.

Additionally, the app features a connection observer that notifies users when there is no internet connection and seamlessly continues functionality when the connection is restored.
